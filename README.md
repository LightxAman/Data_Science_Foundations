# Data_Science_Foundations
This is a repository containing all of my practice for my analytics and Science foundations work. This will range from basic Pandas up to Machine Learning models like Kmeans and Linear Regression. Please feel free to feedback on anything that I have done incorrectly so that I can learn from it.
